- Objects and Fn's very similar in JS
- Object can have property (primitive, another object), and a method
- In memory, will be address with object and then reference where its properties/methods are
    -  [] is an operator for get/set values in object. Looks for property with that name and either gets or sets 
        - better for dynamic values b/c can pass variable   
    - . operator - takes object and looks for the string value of what is given - parser converts to a string
        - b/c is operator (high precedence) will run left to right, looking at each object in that order
- Object literal
     - just use {}, engine will make a new object when sees it, and can set propertis on it
     - split across lines and still treated as one line of code
     - allows creating obj on the fly, like when passing to an argument
        - creating ON THE FLY powerful feature of JS other languages do not have
    - JS engine doing same thing, just syntactic sugar, still just creating an objectwith pointers in memory
- Faking Namespaces
    - NS is container for variables and functions; separates values with same name
    - JS does not have namespaces, issue if value set on global object with same name in different files
    - Objects can be containers that prevent collision in global namespace
- Dot operator is left associative, so if value not found, is undefined, and cannot use dot on undefined
- KEY POINT: associativity/precedence of operators return something, which is the value that is used
- JSON
    - data USED to be sent across internet as xml, but formatting causes many extra characters
    - JSON uses less characters, is a SUBSET of object literals
    - Due to similarity, JS has .stringify to make JSON and .parse to return to object
- FN's are objects
    - First class fn's: everything you can do with other types, you can do with fn's (assign, pass, create on the fly)
    - Special type of object
         - can be anonymous
         - code inside is just another property, which is invocable (then execution ctx created etc)
            - code is just ONE property of fn
         - can attach value/other object/function

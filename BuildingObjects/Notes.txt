- 'new' keyword with class like var a = new b(); was to attract java devs
    - fn constructor is fn that is used to make an object
        - 'new' makes an empty object, then invokes fn (execution ctx) with 'this' pointing to new empty object 
        - JS engine will return new object as long as object does not have a return statement
        - each invocation of 'new' will make a NEW DIFFERENT object

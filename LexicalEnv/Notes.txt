- Syntax Parsers
     - parser to determine if your code grammar is valid
     - ensure compiler/interpreter can read code properly and convert to instructions
     - interpreter can do additional things with your code before instructions are made
- Lexical Environments
    - where something is in your code. place of what you write is important
    - where its written will determine where it sits in memory after it is compiled
- Execution Context
    - wrapper to manage the code you are running
    - which lexical environment is actually running managed by execution context
- Name/Value pair
    - name which maps to unique value. name can only have 1 value in any execution context
    - value can be more more collections
    - Object in JS is collection of name/value pairs
- Code in JS always run in execution context. Base execution context is global context
    - Global context means accessible available anywhere. Creates global object and 'this'

- Initialization
    - Literal Initialization good way to prototype data
- toString() on base object's prototype, and can use .call() on it to get type 
- typeof accepts 1 parameter and tell you what something is
- instanceof - if find object checking for anywhere in prototype chain
- Strict mode ("use strict")
    - at top of file for it to be global or in function for just that execution context
    - tell it to process code in a more regimented way
    - implement extra code when code is parsed
        - ex. variable must be defined to use it
    - every JS engine implements use strict in a different way
    - if code minified, all code defined after "use strict" will be influenced by it
